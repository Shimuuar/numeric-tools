Changes in 0.2.0.1
  * Support for GHC 7.8


Changes in 0.2.0.0
  * Equation solvers now use custom return type.

  * Function to solve equations using Ridder and Newton methods.

  * New function to test approximate equality for doubles.

  * QuadRes contains best approximation achieved even if required
    accuracy is not obtained

  * Improve convergence test when integral converges to
    zero. Convergence is still poor


Changes in 0.1.0.1
  * Fixed bug in quadRomberg which caused crash if algorithm fails to
    converge
